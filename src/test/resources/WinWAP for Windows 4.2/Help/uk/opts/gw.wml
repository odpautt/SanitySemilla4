  <big>Gateway Options:</big><br/><br/>
<i>* Gateway IP<br/></i>
  <small>
  Here you should enter the IP address or Hostname for the WAP Gateway you wish to use. The IP
  is provided by your mobile phone operator for their services, and it is the same IP that you
  would enter into your mobile phone. &#x28;IP address format : 123.123.123.123&#x29;
  <br/><br/>
  <b>Remember to select &#x22;Gateway Mode&#x22; from the &#x22;<a href="gen.wml">General
  Options</a>&#x22; to connect to the Gateway!</b>
  </small>
<br/><br/>
<i>* Connection Port / Mode<br/></i>
  <small>
  Different gateways work in different modes. Here you select the correct mode for the gateway you
  are using. All gateways do not support all modes! The default port values for each mode is the usual
  port that the mode should be used on, but WinWAP will automatically redirect to another port if
  instructed by the gateway. Check with the gateway operator what modes they support - or try using the
  modes. If the browser's statusbar at the bottom shows &#x22;Gateway Error&#x22; a while after saving the options
  then it does not support the selected mode.

<br/><br/>

<i>* Gateway connection timeout<br/></i>
  <small>
  Selects the timeout in milliseconds for gateway connections.
  </small>
<br/><br/>

<i>* Home Page<br/></i>
  <small>
  The URL entered into this field will be opened automatically each time you launch WinWAP, if you are
  in Gateway mode &#x28;This homepage overrides the HTTP homepage when you are using a Gateway&#x29;.
  If you do not wish the browser to open a homepage automatically you should remove any text from
  the field.

  <big>Interface Options:</big><br/><br/>
<i>* Suggest from history<br/></i>
  <small>
  When checked WinWAP suggests locations that you have visited before, while you are typing an address
  into the location field. If a previously entered address is found it suggests it by showing the full
  address, but with the ending part selected so that you can continue typing in the new address. If the
  suggested address is correct, you can go there by pressing enter when the address is suggested.<br/>
  <br/>
   To disable suggestions you uncheck this option.
  </small>
<br/><br/>

<i>* Max number of entries<br/></i>
  <small>
  You can limit the amount of addresses WinWAP remembers internally for the Back and Forward buttons
  whith this option.

<br/><br/>

<i>* Show header before wml source<br/></i>
  <small>
  When checked WinWAP will show the http header in the source viewing window, above the actual wml code.
  To preview the wml code you select &#x22;View source&#x22; from the &#x22;View&#x22; menu.
  </small>
<br/><br/>

<i>* Allow WMLScripts to be run<br/></i>
  <small>
  When checked WinWAP will load and run WMLScripts included in wml pages when found. WMLScripting is a
  scripting lanuage similar to Java that is used with html pages, and can do calculations and other
  functions needed for a WAP service to fuction properly. To disable WMLScript support you uncheck this
  option.

<br/><br/>

<i>* Resolve numerical location to address<br/></i>
  <small>
  WinWAP is designed to work with numerical addresses, such as the bango.net numerical system that is
  the default system after istalling WinWAP. It works in such a way that when entering a number only
  into the location field and pressing enter, WinWAP will resolve the number to an address at the
  numerical resource handler, and forward you to the site that owns that particular number.<br/>
  <br/>
  By default winwap is set up for bango.net, and their handler URL is &#x22;http://winwap.bango.net/&#x22;

  The wml standard has specified it&#x92;s own format for images, called wbmp. These images can be
  displayed with WAP devices on wml pages. WinWAP displays these images, either with a transparent
  background or with white background. &#x28; the format is such that there are only 2 colors available -
  black or white, and white is used as the paper on which the picture is drawn with black &#x29;.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since you can set a background image of your choice for the viewing area from the properties, you can also select
  if you want the pictures to be transparent, or if you want the &#x22;paper&#x22; to be visible behind the wbmp images.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WinWAP also supports color images. The supported formats are GIF, animated GIF and JPG.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You can also view images directly with WinWAP by entering the address of the image instead of the address of a page.

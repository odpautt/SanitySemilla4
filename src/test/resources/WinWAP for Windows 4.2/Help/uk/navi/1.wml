  <big>Typing the address manually</big>
  <br/>
  When the browser opens, it will automatically go to the homepage that can be set in the
  properties. After installation the homepage is Winwap Technologies’s winwap page, where you
  can find information regarding the browser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When you want to read ( retrieve ) the page from another address you should type the
  URL of the page into the address box ( shown below ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After entering the URL you press enter on you keyboard, and the browser will get the
  page for you. You don’t have to type out the http:// part of the address, winwap will
  add it automatically if you don’t. If you want to access a file from a drive you can
  either begin the URL with file:// and then type out the path to the file you want to
  load ( ex : file://D:\WML\index.wml ), or optionally select "Open Location" from the
  "File" menu, and type the path ( or browse to the file ) in the window that opens.

  <big>Automatic forwarding</big>
  <br/>
  The wml format containes elements that make the browser go somwhere automatically. This means
  that when you open a wml page, it might be visible only for a short while, after which it automatically
  opens another page for you without having to click on any link or button. This is usually used on
  Welcome pages that only contain an image and some basic welcome text, and the actual material
  is located somewhere else.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wml format also contains elements that make the browser go somewhere only if you enter the
  page normally or from some other link. If you browse backwards to the link you will not be automatically
  forwarded anywhere. This can also be applied for entering backwards to a page ( by navigating backwards
  with the back button, or with a prev link ) so that if you go backwards to a page, it will forward you somewhere else.
